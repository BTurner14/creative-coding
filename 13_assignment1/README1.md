DAT405 / GAD405 Creative Coding  
===========================================
When opening the file, it should display a white square on a black canvas.
The square should begin to move in any random direction, bouncing off the "walls"
rather than moving off screen.

Clicking on the square will cause it to change to any random colour and you can
do this continuously. Clicking anywhere other than within the square has no
effect.

I used two different resources, listed above, as well as my own knowledge, and worked to merge them together
in order to create something new.
